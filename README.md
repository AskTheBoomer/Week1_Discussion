Difference Between Objects and Classes in Java

In Java, classes are blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of an object.

An object is an instance of a class. It uses that blueprint to store real values and perform actions.

Key Differences

- A class is a definition. An object is an actual instance.
- You can create many objects from one class.
- A class defines structure and behavior. Objects execute and store data.

Example

See `Main.java` and `Car.java` for example code demonstrating how objects and classes work.

To run the program:

```bash
javac Main.java Car.java
java Main
